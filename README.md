#OnepageCRM API
<i>OnePageCRM converts the complexity of a CRM system to a simple to-do list. For more information on OnePageCRM please visit our [website](https://www.onepagecrm.com).</i><br><br>

###OpenAPI 3 Compliance
We've rebuilt the OnepageCRM's API documentation from the ground up to be cleaner, simpler and to comply with the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI3 specification</a>. <br>
We are also releasing our OpenAPI 3 compliant documentation to the public: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/OnePageCRM/swagger">https://github.com/OnePageCRM/swagger</a>.<br>
If you think our docs could be clearer or notice any issues, please let us know. We would also be delighted to receive your pull requests. <br>
You can find a list of tools to work with OpenAPI <a href="http://openapi.tools/">here</a>. Feel free to use any and all of these tools with the the OnepageCRM spec. For example you could generate a client sdk for your favourite language or mock API responses.<br>
In rewriting this documentation we have exposed lots of new features of the API. We hope you enjoy using them! <br>
