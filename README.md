## OpenAPI 3 Compliance
We've rebuilt the OnePageCRM API documentation from the ground up to be cleaner, simpler and to comply with the
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec 3</a>.<br>

We are also releasing our OAS3 compliant documentation to the public:
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/OnePageCRM/swagger">https://github.com/OnePageCRM/swagger</a>.<br>

If you think our docs could be clearer or notice any issues, please let us know (we would also be delighted to
receive pull requests!).<br>

Here is a <a target="_blank" href="https://openapi.tools">list of tools</a> for working with OpenAPI e.g. client
SDK generation (free to use any or all of these tools with the OnePageCRM spec).<br>

In rewriting this documentation we have exposed lots of new features of the API - we hope you enjoy using them!<br>
